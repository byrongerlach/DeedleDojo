Dojo workshop using the F# Deedle exploratory data library

This project contains examples for an interactive workshop for the Deedle exploratory data library: http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/ 

The deedle_tutorial.fsx file is taken directly from the "Deedle in 10 minutes using F#" tutorial available here:

I've included the stocks csv files here:
